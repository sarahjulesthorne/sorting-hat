# Sorting Hat  
### Description  
The project is an exercise in array methods, event listeners, and printing to the dom.  
On page load, a jumbotron appears with a heading, greeting text, and a Let's Get Started button.  
Three stock cards also print to the dom with students' names, randomly generated houses, and house crest images and expel buttons.  
If the Let's Get Started button is pressed, a form appears.  
If a student's name is entered into the form input and Sort button is pressed, a new card appears with the same items as the stock cards, featuring the entered student's name.  
When the Sort button is pressed, the input also clears and the form is hidden.  
If an Expel button is pressed, that student's card is removed from the page and from the aray of student objects.
